# Ignore Patterns

Define which files and directories to exclude during template copy operations. Patterns use glob syntax and are case-sensitive, evaluated against each file's relative path within the template.

You should always exclude version control directories like `.git`, dependency folders like `node_modules`, and build output directories. Never include secrets, API keys, or credentials in templates. Platform-specific files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`) and IDE configurations (`.vscode`, `.idea`) should typically be excluded as well.

## Configuration

Create a `.lancherignore` file in your template root directory. Each line represents a pattern:

```
node_modules
.git
*.log
dist/
build/
```

Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments and help document why specific patterns are excluded:

```
# Dependencies
node_modules/
pnpm-lock.yaml

# Build output (only at root)
/dist
/build

# Logs everywhere
*.log
**/*.log
```

Patterns are evaluated against each file's relative path from the template root. A pattern matches if it matches:
- The file/directory name (basename)
- The full relative path
- Any component of the path

Patterns use the system's filepath matching. An empty `.lancherignore` file will include *ALL* files in the template.

> **Note**: Path separators are normalized automatically. Both `/` and `\` work on all platforms.

## Pattern Types

### Exact Match

Matches the exact file or directory name anywhere in the template:

```
node_modules        # Matches node_modules at any depth
package-lock.json   # Matches this file anywhere
.DS_Store           # Matches .DS_Store in any directory
```

### Wildcards

Use `*` to match any characters (except path separator) and `?` to match a single character:

```
*.log               # Matches any file ending with .log
*.tmp               # Matches any .tmp file
test-*              # Matches test-1, test-data, etc.
file.?              # Matches file.a, file.1, etc.
```

### Root-Relative Patterns

Patterns starting with `/` only match at the template root:

```
/config             # Matches config/ at root, NOT src/config
/build              # Matches build/ at root only
/*.log              # Matches .log files in root directory only
```

### Directories

Trailing slash indicates a directory (optional but clarifies intent):

```
dist/               # Matches dist directory (same as 'dist')
build/              # Matches build directory
.cache/             # Matches .cache directory
```

### Recursive Patterns

Use `**` for recursive matching across any directory depth:

```
**/*.test.js        # Matches .test.js files at any depth
**/node_modules     # Matches node_modules at any level
**/vendor           # Matches vendor directory anywhere
dist/**             # Matches everything under dist/
src/**/test         # Matches test directories under src/
```

## Deprecated Method

> [!WARNING]
> The `ignore` field in `.lancher.yaml` is deprecated and will be removed in a future version. Migrate to `.lancherignore`.

If using the old method, define patterns as an array in `.lancher.yaml`:

```yaml
ignore:
  - node_modules
  - "*.log"
```

**Precedence**: If both `.lancherignore` and the `ignore` field in `.lancher.yaml` exist, `.lancherignore` takes precedence and the YAML ignore field is ignored with a deprecation warning.
